Welcome to the **Game** repository! This project is a robust, high-performance cross-platform game built entirely using the Flutter framework and Dart. It serves as both a fully playable application and a comprehensive boilerplate for modern mobile, web, and desktop game development.

## 🚀 Overview
Developing games in Flutter allows for a single codebase to be deployed natively across iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, and the Web. This repository demonstrates how to manage complex game loops, rendering optimizations, state transitions, and interactive UI elements without compromising on performance. The game targets a smooth **60 to 120 FPS** across all supported devices.

## ✨ Key Features
* **True Cross-Platform Support:** Compile and run natively on mobile, desktop, and web environments from day one.
* **Responsive UI/UX:** Adaptive layouts that scale perfectly across different screen sizes, resolutions, and aspect ratios.
* **High-Performance Rendering:** Optimized painting and animation controllers to ensure zero frame drops during intense gameplay.
* **Persistent Data Storage:** Local caching for high scores, user preferences, and saved game states (Offline-First support).
* **Immersive Audio:** Integrated background music and low-latency sound effects using native audio bridging.
* **Gamepad & Keyboard Support:** Configured inputs for touch screens, external gamepads, and physical keyboards.

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics & Engine
Instead of relying purely on standard UI widgets, this game utilizes a customized rendering loop tailored for performance:
* **The Game Loop:** Driven by Flutter's `Ticker` class, ensuring that entity updates and rendering cycles are perfectly synchronized with the device's screen refresh rate.
* **Collision Detection:** Implementations of Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) and circular collision logic for precise interactions.
* **Sprite Management:** Efficient loading and caching of sprite sheets to reduce memory overhead during active gameplay.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack & Architecture
* **Framework:** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (v3.19+)
* **Language:** Dart 3.0+
* **State Management:** Riverpod / Provider (Decouples UI from game logic)
* **Local Database:** Hive / Isar (For rapid read/write of game states)
* **Audio:** `audioplayers` package for background tracks and short SFX.
